##Python math.e Constant
#The math.e constant returns the Eular's number: 2.718281828459045.
#A float value, 2.718281828459045, representing the mathematical constant e
'''
import math

print(math.e)
'''

##Python math.inf Constant
#The math.inf constant returns a floating-point positive infinity.
#For negative infinity, use -math.inf.
#The inf constant is equivalent to float('inf').
'''
import math

print(math.inf)

print(-math.inf)
'''

##Python math.nan Constant
#The math.nan constant returns a floating-point nan (Not a Number) value. This value is not a legal number.
#The nan constant is equivalent to float('nan').
'''
import math

print(math.nan)
'''

##Python math.pi Constant
#The math.pi constant returns the value of PI: 3.141592653589793.
#Note: Mathematically PI is represented by π.
'''
import math

print(math.pi)
'''

##Python math.tau Constant
#The math.tau constant returns the value of tau, which is 6.283185307179586.
#It is defined as the ratio of the circumference to the radius of a circle. 
#Tau is a circle constant and the value is equivalent to 2π.
#Note: Mathematically tau is represented by τ.
